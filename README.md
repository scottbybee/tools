# tools
tool sharing app
this is a demo app to teach myself about python/flask and new development tools

# to do:

#look on github for a flask template or skeleton
#DONE! 0-refactor so password refers to passwords and hashes are hashes
#1-add code to session and/or app.config to represnt the logged-in status of the user
#prolly the user row plus logged-in=TRUE
#2-Expand the data in the register form and clean up the databbase.
#3-move salt toa config file that is secure and outside the scope of the web app
#so it needs to go in the file that runs on boot (in server mode)
#4-make a user edit page
#5-make a tools crud page; this should be "home" once logged in.
#  list the tools in a table w/ scroll bars (make a user/tool (many-to-many) lookup table)
